* Given HTML: 
```html<div class="images"><img src="/pic.jpg"></div>``` 
Using Nokogiri how would you select the src attribute from the image? Show me two different ways to do that correctly the the HTML given.

* If found HTML was a collection of li tags within a div with class="attr", how would you use Nokogiri to collect that information into one array?
